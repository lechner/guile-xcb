#+DESCRIPTION: A Guile implementation of the X protocol using xml/xcb

* Overview

Guile XCB is an X11 client library written entirely in Guile. It makes
use of the Guile compiler and virtual machine to turn XML descriptions
of the X protocol provided by the XCB project into Guile object code
files.

Support is included for the core X protocol and twenty-seven
extensions. Guile XCB also includes some simple code for running
asynchronous event loops.

* Samples and Documentation

Samples using Guile XCB can be found in the xcb/sample
directory. They include:

- tinywm.scm: A Guile XCB implementation of tinywm
- win.scm: A simple demonstration of creating a window and receiving
  events
- randr.scm: A subset of the xrandr command line tool's functionality


More detailed documentation resides in the texinfo manual included in
this distribution.

* Installation and Prerequisites

You can use the typical ./configure, make, make install chain to build
Guile XCB.

Guile XCB requires the latest release of Guile (2.0.9).

* Project Status and Caveats

- The full XCB stack is implemented; however, many of the extensions
  haven't been tested.

- Extensions that send large requests are probably going to be too slow
  for practical use. In a future release, void and byte lists will be
  represented as bytevectors, not regular vectors.

- Guile XCB includes a stripped-down Scheme implementation of Xauth
  that only supports UNIX sockets for now; it doesn't pick the "best"
  authentication method available, just the first.

- XPRINT is excluded because it's deprecated and its XML file has just
  enough special cases in it that it wasn't worth including. Some
  other deprecated extensions are included simply because there was no
  reason not to.
